# Long Description

This game is a remake of an old game jam entry of ours: [Shroom Island](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/shroom-island/).
Your task is to destroy the mycelium spawners and heal the soil around.
You can wait and the soil recovers slowly over time, or you can place healing stations to heal speed this progress along.
Holding an area until the healers had time to work is critical. 
To assist you in this task you can place defense towers.
Once all the pollution is gone from an area you can descend to the next deeper level.
Collect coins to afford more building structures.
Make sure you gather healing canisters to keep your strength up for the next fight.
Remember there is no regeneration between levels. 
Make sure to recuperate before heading on.
